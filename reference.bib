  abstract = {{Motivation: Networks have been used to model many real-world phenomena to better understand the phenomena and to guide experiments in order to predict their behavior. Since incorrect models lead to incorrect predictions, it is vital to have as accurate a model as possible. As a result, new techniques and models for analyzing and modeling real-world networks have recently been introduced.Results: One example of large and complex networks involves protein--protein interaction (PPI) networks. We analyze PPI networks of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster using a newly introduced measure of local network structure as well as the standardly used measures of global network structure. We examine the fit of four different network models, including Erdös-Rényi, scale-free and geometric random network models, to these PPI networks with respect to the measures of local and global network structure. We demonstrate that the currently accepted scale-free model of PPI networks fails to fit the data in several respects and show that a random geometric model provides a much more accurate model of the PPI data. We hypothesize that only the noise in these networks is scale-free.Conclusions: We systematically evaluate how well-different network models fit the PPI networks. We show that the structure of PPI networks is better modeled by a geometric random graph than by a scale-free model.Supplementary information: Supplementary information is available at http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~juris/data/ppiGRG04/}},

Here reduced means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed.},

  abstract  = {Distributed data processing platforms such as MapReduce and Pregel have substantially simplified the design and deployment of certain classes of distributed graph analytics algorithms. However, these platforms do not represent a good match for distributed graph mining problems, as for example finding frequent subgraphs in a graph. Given an input graph, these problems require exploring a very large number of subgraphs and finding patterns that match some "interestingness" criteria desired by the user. These algorithms are very important for areas such as social networks, semantic web, and bioinformatics.In this paper, we present Arabesque, the first distributed data processing platform for implementing graph mining algorithms. Arabesque automates the process of exploring a very large number of subgraphs. It defines a high-level filter-process computational model that simplifies the development of scalable graph mining algorithms: Arabesque explores subgraphs and passes them to the application, which must simply compute outputs and decide whether the subgraph should be further extended. We use Arabesque's API to produce distributed solutions to three fundamental graph mining problems: frequent subgraph mining, counting motifs, and finding cliques. Our implementations require a handful of lines of code, scale to trillions of subgraphs, and represent in some cases the first available distributed solutions.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we present BlinkDB, a massively parallel, approximate query engine for running interactive SQL queries on large volumes of data. BlinkDB allows users to trade-off query accuracy for response time, enabling interactive queries over massive data by running queries on data samples and presenting results annotated with meaningful error bars. To achieve this, BlinkDB uses two key ideas: (1) an adaptive optimization framework that builds and maintains a set of multi-dimensional stratified samples from original data over time, and (2) a dynamic sample selection strategy that selects an appropriately sized sample based on a query's accuracy or response time requirements. We evaluate BlinkDB against the well-known TPC-H benchmarks and a real-world analytic workload derived from Conviva Inc., a company that manages video distribution over the Internet. Our experiments on a 100 node cluster show that BlinkDB can answer queries on up to 17 TBs of data in less than 2 seconds (over 200 x faster than Hive), within an error of 2-10%.},

Recently,several proposals have been published about various techniques that allow tostore a web graph in memory in a limited space, exploiting the inner redundancies of the web. The WebGraph framework is a suite of codes, algorithms and tools that aims at making it easy to manipulate large web graphs. This papers presents the compression techniques used in WebGraph, which are centred around referentiation and intervalisation (which in turn are dual to each other). WebGraph can compress the WebBase graph (118 Mnodes, 1 Glinks)in as little as 3.08 bits per link, and its transposed version in as littleas 2.89 bits per link.},

The development of this de novo short read assembly method creates new opportunities for building reference sequences and carrying out accurate analyses of unexplored genomes in a cost-effective way.},

The social network perspective focuses on relationships among social entities and is an important addition to standard social and behavioral research, which is primarily concerned with attributes of the social units. Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications reviews and discusses methods for the analysis of social networks with a focus on applications of these methods to many substantive examples. It is a reference book that can be used by those who want a comprehensive review of network methods, or by researchers who have gathered network data and want to find the most appropriate method by which to analyze it. It is also intended for use as a textbook as it is the first book to provide comprehensive coverage of the methodology and applications of the field. },

  abstract             = {10.1098/rsif.2007.1108 Modularity is known to be one of the most relevant characteristics of biological systems and appears to be present at multiple scales. Given its adaptive potential, it is often assumed to be the target of selective pressures. Under such interpretation, selection would be actively favouring the formation of modular structures, which would specialize in different functions. Here we show that, within the context of cellular networks, no such selection pressure is needed to obtain modularity. Instead, the intrinsic dynamics of network growth by duplication and diversification is able to generate it for free and explain the statistical features exhibited by small subgraphs. The implications for the evolution and evolvability of both biological and technological systems are discussed.},

We find that United States, Great Britain, and France are critical from both perspectives; Surprisingly, South Africa is particularly critical from topological point of view. Furthermore, topological and functional criticality are highly correlated to the GDP of a country.}

  abstract  = {Sampling is a standard approach in big-graph analytics; the goal is to efficiently estimate the graph properties by consulting a sample of the whole population. A perfect sample is assumed to mirror every property of the whole population. Unfortunately, such a perfect sample is hard to collect in complex populations such as graphs (e.g. web graphs, social networks), where an underlying network connects the units of the population. Therefore, a good sample will be representative in the sense that graph properties of interest can be estimated with a known degree of accuracy.While previous work focused particularly on sampling schemes to estimate certain graph properties (e.g. triangle count), much less is known for the case when we need to estimate various graph properties with the same sampling scheme. In this paper, we pro- pose a generic stream sampling framework for big-graph analytics, called Graph Sample and Hold (gSH), which samples from massive graphs sequentially in a single pass, one edge at a time, while maintaining a small state in memory. We use a Horvitz-Thompson construction in conjunction with a scheme that samples arriving edges without adjacencies to previously sampled edges with probability p and holds edges with adjacencies with probability q. Our sample and hold framework facilitates the accurate estimation of subgraph patterns by enabling the dependence of the sampling process to vary based on previous history. Within our framework, we show how to produce statistically unbiased estimators for various graph properties from the sample. Given that the graph analytics will run on a sample instead of the whole population, the runtime complexity is kept under control. Moreover, given that the estimators are unbiased, the approximation error is also kept under control. Finally, we test the performance of the proposed framework (gSH) on various types of graphs, showing that from a sample with -- 40K edges, it produces estimates with relative errors &lt; 1%.},

  abstract   = {How can we estimate local triangle counts accurately in a graph stream without storing the whole graph? How to handle duplicated edges in local triangle counting for graph stream? Local triangle counting, which computes the number of triangles attached to each node in a graph, is a very important problem with wide applications in social network analysis, anomaly detection, web mining, and the like.In this article, we propose algorithms for local triangle counting in a graph stream based on edge sampling: Mascot for a simple graph, and MultiBMascot and MultiWMascot for a multigraph. To develop Mascot, we first present two naive local triangle counting algorithms in a graph stream, called Mascot-C and Mascot-A. Mascot-C is based on constant edge sampling, and Mascot-A improves its accuracy by utilizing more memory spaces. Mascot achieves both accuracy and memory-efficiency of the two algorithms by unconditional triangle counting for a new edge, regardless of whether it is sampled or not. Extending the idea to a multigraph, we develop two algorithms MultiBMascot and MultiWMascot. MultiBMascot enables local triangle counting on the corresponding simple graph of a streamed multigraph without explicit graph conversion; MultiWMascot considers repeated occurrences of an edge as its weight and counts each triangle as the product of its three edge weights. In contrast to the existing algorithm that requires prior knowledge on the target graph and appropriately set parameters, our proposed algorithms require only one parameter of edge sampling probability.Through extensive experiments, we show that for the same number of edges sampled, Mascot provides the best accuracy compared to the existing algorithm as well as Mascot-C and Mascot-A. We also demonstrate that MultiBMascot on a multigraph is comparable to Mascot-C on the counterpart simple graph, and MultiWMascot becomes more accurate for higher degree nodes. Thanks to Mascot, we also discover interesting anomalous patterns in real graphs, including core-peripheries in the web, a bimodal call pattern in a phone call history, and intensive collaboration in DBLP.},

  abstract = {Given a multigraph stream (e.g., Facebook messages or network traffic) where duplicate edges arrive continuously, how can we accurately and memory-efficiently estimate local triangles for all nodes? Local triangle counting in a graph stream is one of the fundamental tasks in graph mining with important applications including anomaly detection, social role identification, community detection, etc. Many recent graph streams include duplicate edges, hence form multigraph streams: e.g., many network packets might have a same (source, destination) pair. Although there have been several local triangle counting methods for multigraph streams, they have problems in terms of accuracy and memory efficiency; furthermore, most methods support either binary or weighted counting, and thus cannot find anomalies whose detection requires both types of counting. In this paper, we propose FURL, a memory-efficient and accurate local triangle counting method for multigraph streams. FURL has two main advantages. First, FURL improves accuracy by (1) reducing the variance of its estimation via a regularization strategy, and (2) sampling more triangles than the state-of-the-art methods do, by using its memory space efficiently. Second, FURL finds anomalies which state-of-the-art methods cannot discover. Experimental results show that FURL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and memory efficiency. Thanks to FURL, we discover interesting anomalies from a Bitcoin network.},

  abstract   = {Counting triangles in a large graph is important for detecting network anomalies such as spam web pages and suspicious accounts (e.g., fraudsters and advertisers) on online social networks. However, it is challenging to compute the number of triangles in a large graph represented as a stream of edges with a low computational cost when given a limited memory. Recently, several effective sampling-based approximation methods have been developed to solve this problem. However, they assume the graph stream of interest contains no duplicate edges, which does not hold in many real-world graph streams (e.g., phone calling networks). In this paper, we observe that these methods exhibit a large estimation error or computational cost even when modified to deal with duplicate edges using deduplication techniques such as Bloom filter and hash-based sampling. To solve this challenge, we design a one-pass streaming algorithm for uniformly sampling distinct edges at a high speed. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, our algorithm reduces the sampling cost per edge from O(log k) (k is the maximum number of sampled edges determined by the available memory space) to O(1) without using any additional memory space. Based on sampled edges, we develop a simple yet accurate method to infer the number of triangles in the original graph stream. We conduct extensive experiments on a variety of real-world large graphs, and the results demonstrate that our method is several times more accurate and faster than state-of-the-art methods with the same memory usage.},

In SWTC, we propose a fixed-length slicing strategy that addresses both unbiased sampling and cardinality estimation issues with a bounded memory usage. We theoretically prove the superiority of our method in sample graph size and estimation accuracy under given memory upper bound. Extensive experiments also confirm that our approach has higher accuracy compared with the baseline method under the same memory usage.},

@article{Statistical,
  abstract    = {  Complex networks describe a wide range of systems in nature and society, much
                 quoted examples including the cell, a network of chemicals linked by chemical
                 reactions, or the Internet, a network of routers and computers connected by
                 physical links. While traditionally these systems were modeled as random
                 graphs, it is increasingly recognized that the topology and evolution of real
                 networks is governed by robust organizing principles. Here we review the recent
                 advances in the field of complex networks, focusing on the statistical
                 mechanics of network topology and dynamics. After reviewing the empirical data
                 that motivated the recent interest in networks, we discuss the main models and
                 analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world and scale-free networks,
                 as well as the interplay between topology and the network's robustness against
                 failures and attacks.

@article{clauset2007powerlaw,
  abstract    = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and
                 have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made
                 phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is
                 complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the
                 distribution -- the part of the distribution representing large but rare events
                 -- and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior
                 holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as
                 least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of
                 parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods
                 return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no
                 indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a
                 principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law
                 behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting
                 methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic
                 and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests
                 on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also
                 apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of
                 different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law
                 distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the
                 data while in others the power law is ruled out.},
